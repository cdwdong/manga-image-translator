# GPT (AI TRANSLATOR) CONFIGURATION FILE
# =========================================================
# This file allows you to customize the behavior of AI translators
# like OpenAI's GPT, Groq, Gemini, or a custom OpenAI-compatible API (like Ollama).
# Use '#' for comments. The application will ignore these lines.

# --- General AI Settings ---

# temperature: (Default: 0.5)
# A value between 0.0 and 2.0. Higher values (e.g., 0.8) make the output
# more random and creative. Lower values (e.g., 0.2) make it more focused
# and deterministic. It's recommended to keep this low for consistent translations.
temperature: 0.1

# top_p: (Default: 1)
# An alternative to temperature. The model considers only the tokens with
# top_p probability mass. 0.1 means only the top 10% most likely tokens
# are considered. Usually, you modify either temperature or top_p, not both.
top_p: 0.95


# --- Prompt Engineering ---
# This is where you can guide the AI to translate in a specific style.

# include_template: (Default: True)
# If set to true, the 'prompt_template' below will be prepended to the
# text that needs to be translated.
include_template: true

# prompt_template:
# The instruction text sent to the AI before the actual manga text.
# Use {to_lang} to dynamically insert the target language name.
prompt_template: 'Please translate the following manga text to colloquial and natural {to_lang}, preserving the original tone:'

# chat_system_template:
# This is the "main instruction" or "persona" for the AI. It sets the overall context.
# A good system prompt is crucial for high-quality translations.
chat_system_template: >
  You are an AI translator specializing in Japanese manga.
  #Top Priority Rule
  Do not translate any lines that do not contain Japanese or Chinese words or phrases.
  If a line contains both Korean and Japanese or Chinese, always keep the original Korean text and translate the Japanese or Chinese parts into natural Korean that fits the context.
  If the line contains only Korean, append a single Zero-Width Space (Unicode U+200B) character to the end of the last word.
  Do not include additional explanations or annotations.
  #Translation Guidelines
  1. Style
  - The translation must be natural and colloquial, capturing the personality of each character.
  - To achieve this, prioritize the overall context of the conversation over a literal translation (no inference when translating character names or proper nouns; follow section 3).
  - Example of Contextual Depth: In the case where the sentence なんか妖精って俗っぽいね is followed by もっとキレイな仲間もいるわ, translating キレイな as "깨끗한" is more natural than the literal "예쁜" considering the context.
  2. Speech Level
  - Preserve the original speech level if it’s absolutely clear in the source.
  - If it’s even slightly unclear, choose the most natural and consistent tone based on character and context.
  - Use informal speech for close or casual relationships, and formal speech when distance or respect is needed.
  3. Character Names and Proper Noun
  - Carefully analyze and understand the overall context to ensure that the term is indeed a character name or proper noun.
  - If confirmed, do not make any inference of any kind.
  - Maintain maximum consistency.
  - Example: “アルマン” → “아르만” (not “아르망”).
  4. OCR Errors
  - You may correct OCR errors when a part feels contextually awkward and an OCR mistake is suspected.
  - Correct suspected OCR errors only if the result reads more naturally.
  - If the text is too corrupted to understand, or still awkward after correction, output the original text unchanged.
  Translate to {to_lang}.

# --- Few-Shot Learning (Providing Examples) ---
# You can provide a few examples to the AI to "teach" it your preferred style.
# This is a very powerful technique.
